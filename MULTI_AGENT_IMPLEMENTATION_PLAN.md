# Multi-Agent Loan Processing System - Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Epic**: #62 - Multi-Agent Loan Processing System
**Related Issues**: #64 (Credit), #65 (Income), #66 (Risk), #67 (Orchestrator)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

1. **Complete multi-agent workflow** with Credit, Income, Risk agents + Orchestrator
2. **Comprehensive logging** for agent handoffs without performance degradation
3. **All MCP servers operational** with proper agent-to-tool assignments
4. **End-to-end integration tests** with NO mocks (real MCP servers)
5. **Comprehensive unit tests** for each agent (85%+ coverage)
6. **Documentation updates** as we proceed with ADRs for decisions
7. **Multiple commits** - one per agent for easy issue tracking

---

## ðŸ“‹ Architecture Decision Summary

Based on Architecture Review (`ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_MULTI_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`):

### âœ… Key Decisions
1. **Use IntakeAgent as canonical pattern** - All agents follow same structure
2. **Explicit Orchestration** - NOT using SequentialBuilder (need conditional routing)
3. **Progressive logging** - INFO for handoffs, DEBUG for tool calls
4. **MCP Tool Assignment**:
   - Intake: verification (8010)
   - Credit: verification (8010) + calculations (8012)
   - Income: verification (8010) + documents (8011) + calculations (8012)
   - Risk: ALL three MCP servers (comprehensive analysis)
5. **Error Handling**: Always return response, never throw unhandled exceptions
6. **Testing**: Real MCP servers via MCPTestHarness, no mocks for integration

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Agent Implementations (Issues #64, #65, #66)**

#### Step 1.1: Credit Agent (#64)
**Files**:
- `apps/api/loan_avengers/agents/credit_agent.py`
- `tests/unit/agents/test_credit_agent.py`

**Pattern** (following `intake_agent.py`):
```python
class CreditAgent:
    def __init__(self, chat_client, temperature=0.2, max_tokens=600):
        # Load persona from PersonaLoader
        # Create MCP tools: verification (8010) + calculations (8012)
        # Store configuration

    async def process_application(self, application, thread, previous_assessments):
        async with self.verification_tool, self.calculations_tool:
            # Create ChatAgent with response_format=CreditAssessment
            # Include previous_assessments in message context
            # Return AgentResponse[CreditAssessment]
```

**MCP Tools**:
- `application-verification` (8010): `retrieve_credit_report()`, `verify_employment()`
- `financial-calculations` (8012): `calculate_debt_to_income_ratio()`, `calculate_credit_utilization_ratio()`

**Logging Points**:
- Agent initialization (INFO)
- Processing start with previous context flag (INFO)
- Tool calls (DEBUG)
- Credit analysis completed with score/risk (INFO)
- Errors with context (ERROR)

**Unit Tests**:
- Agent initialization
- Process application with mock chat client
- Error handling scenarios
- Response parsing and validation

**Commit**: `feat: implement Credit Agent following IntakeAgent pattern (#64)`

        # Load persona from PersonaLoader
        # Create MCP tools: verification (8010) + documents (8011) + calculations (8012)
        # Store configuration

    async def process_application(self, application, thread, previous_assessments):
        async with self.verification_tool, self.documents_tool, self.calculations_tool:
            # Create ChatAgent with response_format=IncomeAssessment
            # Include previous_assessments (intake + credit) in message context
            # Return AgentResponse[IncomeAssessment]
```

**MCP Tools**:
- `application-verification` (8010): `verify_employment()`, `get_bank_account_data()`, `get_tax_transcript_data()`
- `document-processing` (8011): `extract_text_from_document()`, `validate_document_format()`
- `financial-calculations` (8012): `analyze_income_stability()`, `calculate_loan_affordability()`

**Logging Points**:
- Agent initialization (INFO)
- Processing start with previous context summary (INFO)
- Tool calls for each MCP server (DEBUG)
- Income verification completed with stability assessment (INFO)
- Errors with context (ERROR)

**Unit Tests**:

        # Load persona from PersonaLoader
        # Create MCP tools: ALL three (verification + documents + calculations)
        # Store configuration

    async def process_application(self, application, thread, previous_assessments):
        async with self.verification_tool, self.documents_tool, self.calculations_tool:
            # Create ChatAgent with response_format=RiskAssessment
            # Include ALL previous_assessments (intake + credit + income) in context

**Logging Strategy**:
- Workflow start (INFO)
- Each agent handoff with routing info (INFO)
- Each agent completion with key metrics (INFO)
- Decision synthesis (INFO)
- Errors at any step (ERROR with full context)

**Unit Tests**:
- Orchestrator initialization
- Standard workflow path
- Fast-track workflow path
- Decision synthesis logic
- Error handling at each stage
- Partial results handling

**Commit**: `feat: implement LoanProcessingOrchestrator with explicit workflow (#67)`

### **Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure**

#### Step 3.1: MCPTestHarness
**Files**:
- `tests/integration/test_harness.py`

**Purpose**: Start all 3 MCP servers for integration tests (NO MOCKS!)

```python
class MCPTestHarness:
    """
    Test harness for running integration tests with real MCP servers.

    Starts all 3 MCP servers on their designated ports:
    - application_verification: 8010
    - document_processing: 8011
    - financial_calculations: 8012
    """

    async def __aenter__(self):
        """Start all MCP servers."""
        self.servers = []
        self.servers.append(await self._start_server("application_verification", 8010))
        self.servers.append(await self._start_server("document_processing", 8011))
        self.servers.append(await self._start_server("financial_calculations", 8012))

        # Wait for health checks
        await self._wait_for_health()

        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        """Stop all MCP servers."""

    async def _start_server(self, name, port):
        """Start individual MCP server process."""
        # Implementation to start server as subprocess
        pass

    async def _wait_for_health(self):
        """Wait for all servers to be healthy."""
        # Poll health check endpoints
        pass
```

**Commit**: `test: create MCPTestHarness for integration testing`

---

#### Step 3.2: Integration Tests
**Files**:
- `tests/integration/test_multi_agent_workflow.py`
- `tests/integration/test_credit_agent_integration.py`
- `tests/integration/test_income_agent_integration.py`
- `tests/integration/test_risk_agent_integration.py`

**Coverage**:
- End-to-end workflow (intake â†’ credit â†’ income â†’ risk â†’ decision)
- Fast-track routing (intake â†’ credit â†’ risk â†’ decision)
- Each agent with real MCP servers
- Error scenarios (MCP server down, timeout, tool failure)
- Performance tests (<3 minute SLA)

**Example Test**:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_end_to_end_workflow_with_real_mcp_servers():
    """Test complete workflow with all real MCP servers."""

    async with MCPTestHarness():
        # Create test application
        application = create_test_application()

        # Run through orchestrator
        orchestrator = LoanProcessingOrchestrator()
        result = await orchestrator.process_application(application)

        # Verify decision structure
        assert result.assessment.decision in ["APPROVED", "DECLINED", "CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED"]
        assert result.assessment.confidence_score > 0.0
        assert len(result.assessment.processing_summary) > 0

        # Verify all agents were invoked
        # (check logs or response metadata)
```

**Commit**: `test: add comprehensive integration tests with real MCP servers`

## ðŸš¨ Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: MCP Server Integration Complexity
**Mitigation**: Test each agent individually with MCP servers before orchestrator integration

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation from Logging
**Mitigation**: Use DEBUG level for detailed logs, INFO only for handoffs and milestones

### Risk 3: Integration Test Flakiness
**Mitigation**: MCPTestHarness with proper health checks and retry logic

### Risk 4: Unclear Agent Handoff Requirements
**Mitigation**: Architecture review completed, patterns documented in ADRs
