## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Multi-Agent Workflow System**
Built on **Microsoft Agent Framework** with sequential agent processing:

```
Web App (Alisha) → John (Validation) → Sarah (Income) → Marcus (Credit) → Alex (Risk) → Result
```

### **Core Technologies**
- **Microsoft Agent Framework**: Multi-agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Pydantic v2**: Type-safe data models with comprehensive validation
- **MCP Servers**: External tool integration for verification and calculations
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live progress updates during agent processing
- **Agent Framework Observability**: Built-in telemetry and performance tracking

### **Microsoft Agent Framework Capabilities Used**
- **ChatAgent**: Personality-driven agent creation with structured responses
- **AgentThread**: Conversation context management for multi-turn interactions
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Sequential agent processing with automatic handoffs
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live progress updates during agent execution
- **Built-in Observability**: Automatic telemetry, usage tracking, and performance monitoring
- **Pydantic Integration**: Type-safe response parsing with `response_format` parameter
- **MCP Tool Integration**: External service connections for verification and calculations

## 🎯 **Performance Goals**

### **Loan Processing Targets**
- **John (Validation)**: <5 seconds application validation and routing
- **Sarah (Income)**: <30 seconds income verification and employment validation
- **Marcus (Credit)**: <60 seconds credit assessment and scoring
- **Alex (Risk)**: <90 seconds comprehensive risk analysis and decision
- **Total Workflow**: <3 minutes end-to-end processing vs traditional 24-48 hours

### **Technical Benefits**
- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent focused on specific domain expertise
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Microsoft Agent Framework handles complex coordination
- **Observability**: Built-in telemetry and performance monitoring
- **Scalability**: Independent agent scaling based on processing bottlenecks
