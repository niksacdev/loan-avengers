# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This page catalogs all architectural decisions made during the development of the Loan Defenders system.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document significant architectural choices, their context, and consequences. They help maintain institutional knowledge and provide rationale for future developers.

### Assessments
- [ADR-014: Unified Workflow Architecture Assessment](decisions/adr-014-unified-workflow-architecture-assessment.md)

## ADR Categories

### üèóÔ∏è Strategic Foundation
Foundational architectural decisions that shape the entire system.

### üîå API & Orchestration
Decisions about how agents communicate and coordinate workflows.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure
Deployment, hosting, and operational infrastructure choices.

### üìä Assessments
Retrospective evaluations of architectural approaches.

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Copy the ADR template from `docs/architecture/decisions/adr-template.md`
2. Number sequentially (ADR-XXX)
3. Include: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Implementation
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Update this index page
