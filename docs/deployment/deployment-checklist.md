- [ ] Quota limits: Check TPM allocation and limits
- [ ] Private endpoint: Verify DNS resolution and connectivity

### **Container Apps Issues**
- [ ] Image pull errors: Check container registry access
- [ ] Environment variables: Verify Key Vault integration
- [ ] Networking: Confirm subnet delegation and NSG rules

### **GitHub Actions Issues**
- [ ] Secret access: Verify all required secrets configured
- [ ] Service principal: Check permissions and expiration
