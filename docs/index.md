## What is Loan Avengers?

Loan Avengers is a **demonstration project** that showcases how to build production-grade multi-agent systems using:

- **Microsoft Agent Framework** - Orchestrating specialized AI agents
- **Azure AI Foundry** - Enterprise AI model deployment
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Secure, standardized tool servers
- **Azure Cloud** - Scalable, secure infrastructure

### Key Features

ðŸ¦¸ **AI Dream Team**: Five specialized agents working together:
- **Cap-ital America** (Coordinator) - Orchestrates the entire workflow
- **Hawkeye** (Intake Specialist) - Validates and routes applications
- **Scarlet Witch-Credit** (Credit Specialist) - Analyzes creditworthiness
- **Hawk-Income** (Income Specialist) - Verifies income and employment
- **Doctor Strange-Risk** (Risk Advisor) - Makes final lending decisions

âš¡ **Under 2 Minutes**: Complete loan processing from application to decision

ðŸ”’ **Privacy-First**: Secure handling of PII with UUID-based identification

ðŸŽ¯ **AI-Augmented Development**: Single developer productivity of an 8-12 person team

## Why This Project Exists

This project demonstrates:

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns** - How to coordinate specialized AI agents
2. **MCP Server Integration** - Building reusable, secure AI tools
3. **AI-Augmented Development** - Revolutionary productivity with AI coding assistants
4. **Production-Ready Practices** - Testing, observability, CI/CD, and deployment
5. **Responsible AI** - Privacy, security, and ethical considerations

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, Microsoft Agent Framework
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **AI Platform**: Azure AI Foundry (GPT-4)
- **MCP Servers**: Application Verification, Document Processing, Financial Calculations

## Project Philosophy

This project embodies a **revolutionary AI-augmented development workflow** where:

- **One developer** leverages multiple AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, Cursor)
- **Specialized AI agents** handle different aspects of development (architecture, UX, code review, PM)
- **Systematic workflows** ensure quality and consistency
- **Documentation-driven development** maintains clarity and onboarding ease
