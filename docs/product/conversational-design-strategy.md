## Conversation Flow Scripts

### Opening Sequence: Meeting the Team

**Riley**: "Hi there! I'm Riley, and I'm absolutely excited to help you with your loan today. I work with three incredible specialists who are going to make sure you get exactly what you need. What's your name?"

**User**: "Sarah"

**Riley**: "Sarah! Great to meet you. I love helping people like you achieve their financial goals. Are you looking to buy your first home, refinance an existing mortgage, or maybe invest in property?"

**User**: "First home"

**Riley**: "That's so exciting! Buying your first home is a huge milestone. I'm going to connect you with my team right now. They've already looked at your profile and have some great news to share. Ready to meet them?"

### Credit Assessment Conversation

**Sarah (Credit Specialist)**: "Hi Sarah! I'm Sarah - yes, same name! I'm your credit specialist, and I have fantastic news. I just analyzed your credit profile, and you have a 760 score - that puts you in the top 15% of all borrowers!"

**User**: "Really? That's good?"

**Sarah (Credit)**: "It's not just good, it's excellent! Here's what that means for you: you qualify for our best rates, starting at 6.2%. With your credit score, lenders see you as extremely reliable. You've clearly been managing your finances really well."

**User**: "What about that late payment from two years ago?"

**Sarah (Credit)**: "I see that, and honestly? It's not a concern at all. One late payment that far back, with perfect payment history since then, actually shows lenders that you learned and improved. That's exactly what we like to see. Your recent payment history is flawless."

### Income Verification Flow

**Marcus**: "Sarah, this is Marcus, your income specialist. I just verified your employment at TechCorp - congratulations on that promotion last year! Your income progression shows real stability and growth."

**User**: "How did you verify it so quickly?"

**Marcus**: "We have partnerships with major employers that allow instant verification. I can see your salary, length of employment, and even your performance trajectory. Your current $120K salary easily supports the loan amount you're considering, with plenty of room for comfort."

**User**: "What about my freelance work on weekends?"

**Marcus**: "I see that too! The extra income actually strengthens your application. You're earning about $15K annually from freelance work, which shows initiative and adds to your overall financial picture. I'll include that in your qualification."

### Risk Assessment Dialogue

**Alex**: "Hi Sarah, I'm Alex, your risk advisor. I just completed my analysis, and I'm happy to report zero red flags in your financial profile. Want to know what I looked at?"

**User**: "Yes, I'm curious"

**Alex**: "I analyzed your debt-to-income ratio, savings patterns, spending habits, and overall financial health. Here's what stands out: you're saving 20% of your income consistently, your only debt is student loans and a car payment - both managed perfectly - and you have six months of expenses in emergency savings."

**User**: "Is that good enough?"

**Alex**: "It's not just good enough, it's exceptional! Most applicants have 1-2 months savings. You have six months, which shows incredible financial discipline. From a risk perspective, you're what we call a 'dream borrower.'"

### Loan Building Experience

**Riley**: "Okay Sarah, now for the fun part! Let's build your perfect loan. Based on your credit, income, and the home price range you mentioned, I have three options that work beautifully for you."

*[Visual: Three animated cards appear showing loan options]*

**Riley**: "Option 1: 30-year fixed at 6.2% gives you payments of $1,847 per month. That's only 18% of your monthly income - very comfortable.

Option 2: 15-year fixed at 5.9% would be $2,521 monthly, but you'd own your home outright 15 years sooner and save $180K in interest.

Option 3: ARM starting at 5.8% begins at $1,759 monthly for five years, then adjusts.

Which one feels right for your situation?"

**User**: "The 30-year sounds safest"

**Riley**: "Excellent choice! Safety and comfort are exactly what your first home should provide. Let me show you what this looks like with different down payment amounts."

*[Interactive sliders appear]*

**Riley**: "If you put 20% down, your monthly payment stays at $1,847 with no PMI. If you prefer to put less down and keep more cash available, 10% down makes your payment $2,067 with PMI that drops off once you reach 20% equity. What feels better for your situation?"

### Document Collection Process

**Riley**: "Perfect! Now I need just three quick documents to finalize everything. The great news is I already have most of your information from your profile."

**User**: "What do you need?"

**Riley**: "Just your last two pay stubs and your most recent bank statement. I can already see your bank account and savings from your linked accounts, so this is just for final verification. Want to upload them now, or would you prefer to take photos with your phone?"

**User**: "I'll take photos"

**Riley**: "Great! I'll guide you through it. First, your most recent pay stub. Just snap a clear photo - I'll tell you if I need a better shot."

*[User uploads document]*

**Riley**: "Perfect! I can read everything clearly. Marcus is processing it now... and he's done! One down, two to go. Next is your second most recent pay stub."

### Real-Time Processing Experience

**Riley**: "Excellent! I have everything I need. Now comes the exciting part - watching my team work their magic. This takes about two minutes, and you'll see everything happening in real-time."

*[Progress visualization begins]*

**Sarah (Credit)**: "Starting credit analysis... Complete! âœ“ (28 seconds)"
*[Shows: Credit score verified, payment history excellent, credit utilization optimal]*

**Marcus**: "Income verification in progress... Done! âœ“ (43 seconds)"
*[Shows: Employment confirmed, salary verified, debt-to-income ratio excellent]*

**Alex**: "Risk assessment underway... Finished! âœ“ (67 seconds)"
*[Shows: Financial stability excellent, savings strong, risk level minimal]*

**Riley**: "Final approval processing... Approved! âœ“ (89 seconds)"

*[Confetti animation, celebration music]*

### Approval Celebration

**Riley**: "CONGRATULATIONS SARAH! You're officially approved for $485,000 at 6.2%! ðŸŽ‰"

**Sarah (Credit)**: "Your excellent credit made this possible!"

**Marcus**: "Your strong income sealed the deal!"

**Alex**: "Your financial responsibility made this a no-brainer!"

**Riley**: "Sarah, you just took the biggest step toward homeownership! Your pre-approval letter is being generated right now, and you'll have it in your email within minutes."

**User**: "I can't believe it was that easy!"

**Riley**: "It should be easy when you've done everything right financially. You earned this approval through years of responsible money management. Now the fun really begins - house hunting!"

## Edge Case Conversations

### Conditional Approval Scenario

**Riley**: "Sarah, I have your results! You're approved for $450,000 at 6.4% with one small condition that's easy to handle."

**User**: "What condition?"

**Riley**: "Alex noticed you have a small balance on a credit card that's showing 85% utilization. It's not a deal-breaker at all, but paying it down to under 30% would improve your rate to 6.2% and increase your approval to $485,000. Want to do that?"

**User**: "How much do I need to pay?"

**Riley**: "Just $800 on your Chase card would do it. You have plenty in savings, and it would save you $43 per month on your mortgage payment. Worth it?"

### Referral to Human Specialist

**Riley**: "Sarah, your application is a bit more complex than our AI team typically handles, but that's not a problem at all! I'm connecting you with Jennifer, our senior loan specialist who specializes in situations like yours."

**User**: "Is something wrong?"

**Riley**: "Not at all! You're self-employed, which just means we need a human expert to review your business income documentation. Jennifer has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs get approved. She'll be able to work with your tax returns and profit/loss statements to get you the best possible terms."

### Denial with Supportive Guidance

**Riley**: "Sarah, I need to share some challenging news, but I want you to know this isn't the end of the road."

**User**: "I'm not approved?"

**Riley**: "Not yet, but here's the important part - I can show you exactly how to get approved in 3-6 months. Alex found that your debt-to-income ratio is currently 52%, and we need it under 43% for approval."

**Alex**: "Sarah, you're actually really close! Paying down $12,000 in credit card debt would get you approved. I can see you have the income to do this - want me to show you a plan?"

**User**: "Yes, please"

**Alex**: "Perfect! If you put $2,000 monthly toward your credit cards - which you can afford based on your spending patterns - you'll be ready to reapply in 6 months. I'll also show you how this will improve your credit score by 40+ points."

## Conversation Design Guidelines

### Language Principles
1. **Use "You" statements**: "You qualify" vs "The applicant qualifies"
2. **Active voice**: "I found" vs "It was found"
3. **Present tense**: "Your credit shows" vs "Your credit has shown"
4. **Positive framing**: "You have excellent payment history" vs "No late payments found"

### Emotional Design
1. **Celebration language**: "Fantastic!", "Excellent!", "Outstanding!"
2. **Confidence building**: "You've clearly been managing finances well"
3. **Achievement framing**: "You earned this approval"
4. **Progress language**: "You're almost there", "Next step", "Moving forward"

### Technical Complexity Management
1. **Explain before using jargon**: "Debt-to-income ratio - that's how much you pay in debts vs. how much you earn"
2. **Use analogies**: "Think of PMI as insurance for the lender"
3. **Provide context**: "This is excellent because most borrowers..."
4. **Offer deeper explanation**: "Want me to explain more about how this works?"

### Accessibility in Conversation
1. **Screen reader friendly**: All important information repeated in text
2. **Clear navigation**: "Press 1 to continue, 2 to repeat, 3 for help"
3. **Simple language**: Avoid complex financial terminology without explanation
4. **Confirmation requests**: "Does that make sense?" "Any questions about this?"
