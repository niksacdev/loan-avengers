"""
Deterministic conversation state machine for loan application data collection.

This replaces the LLM-based ConversationAgent with a predictable state machine
that uses pre-scripted Cap-ital America messages for engaging user experience.

Pattern: Code-Based State Machine
- Deterministic state transitions (no LLM needed for conversation flow)
- Pre-scripted personality-rich messages
- Invokes LoanProcessingPipeline when data collection complete
- Streams agent updates back to UI
