Loan Processing Pipeline - Automated loan assessment workflow.

Sequential agent pipeline: Intake â†’ Credit â†’ Income â†’ Risk

Pattern: Sequential Orchestration
- Accepts validated LoanApplication as input
- Executes specialized agents in predefined order
- Each agent passes context to next stage
- Produces structured assessment and final decision
